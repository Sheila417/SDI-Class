<p>Hello, I'm Sheila and I am a mother to a wonderful 2 year-old girl. I am a really busy person. My life revolves around my family and school. I mostly spend more time doing schoolwork but I know its for a good cause. My family is really supportive and I am thankful for that. I have to say I am lucky o have a family that really tries hard to work around my school schedule.</p>
<p>I recently moved out of my parents house and I feel proud of my family and myself. A big step like this for someone who is just starting a life of their own is, pretty big we could say. Its a challenge, a challenge Im willing to take, just like Mobile Development. This is entirely new to me I mean I have dealt with this but not the whole thing. So I am really looking forward to this program and all the new challenges in putting myself into.</p>
